So we are still looking to accomplish the following:


1. Need to acquire ftp data display and storage
2. Make the connection from the router ETH to IP connection
    - Individual computers send ethernet requests to the Asus Router which makes internet requests
    - Need to match ethernet request to internet request in order to determine website visited by the
       each individual computer
3. Need to be able to save target's packet list to file - DONE 11/23/18
4. Need to be able to load individual data into capture file - DONE
5. Need to add live capture sniff capabilities -  DONE 11/26/18
6. Need to use subprocess to connect to wifi - Not going to happen
7. Need to possible utilize a wifi brute force - Not going to happen
8. Display selected Highest Layer - 11/26/18




-  Also need to do powerpoint and reflections and add comments to code

11/25/18
 - Added Save capabilities for both full cap file and target packet repositories
 - Added file manager class

 Will work on live capture as well as placing comments in through code

 also need to create power point
 -brief intro to wireshark
 -need for ability to quickly parse files
 -instantaneous capture ability

 - test subject was house
 - issues include missing some of the computers on the network - Bootp would have been nice, filtering internet traffic

Ok so issues with live capture:
  - Currently working how internet filtering is bugged
  - Displays # of packets capture in capture object, yet packet number is much higher
  - Very slow when Hunter object is capturing targets in a live capture file
       * Assumption is that several calls to memory must be made for the type of capture object


- Still need to put together power point and individual reflections.  Will work on this tomorrow as well as comments in code
